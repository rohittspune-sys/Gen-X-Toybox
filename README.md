# Gen X Toybox (Frontend Demo)

A modern, responsive e-commerce frontend for a retro-meets-modern toy store. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. Includes homepage, shop with filters, product pages, cart, wishlist, blog, contact, order tracking, and an admin dashboard with mock analytics and inventory overrides (persisted in localStorage).

## Run locally

- Use any static server in the workspace root, for example:

```bash
npx serve -s .
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL shown) in your browser.

## Notes
- Payments (Stripe/PayPal) are placeholders; checkout creates a mock order for tracking.
- SEO basics: meta tags and structured data on homepage; add more as needed.
- Mobile-first, fast-loading, lazy images, minimal JS.
